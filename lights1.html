            cHALLENGE ZERO:
        </h2>
        <p class="lights">
            The first challenge in the Python LED Project was to create a circut that lights up at least one light. In the images on the right, the red, larger wire is the power conduit, and the brown wire of the same size is the "ground" connection. As with much of this project, simplicity is not my forte. I'd rather make things complicated, especially when it comes to challenging others, and as such, this is the result. This wiring, despite looking like earbuds after they come out of the pockets, powers the lights because the power connects to the same bar as the resistor, and the ground connects to the same bar as the negative ends of the lights. Thus light.
